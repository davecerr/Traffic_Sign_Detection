# Traffic_Sign_Detection

For a self-driving vehicle to operate safely and within the contstraints of the law, it is important that it is able to read and comprehend traffic signs.

In this project, we use a Convolutional Neural Network that incorporates multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers and an inception module to classify traffic signs from the [German traffic sign dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

I ahve written a post explaining the problem and the techniques involved in the solution at [https://daviderrington.net/2018/06/25/reading-and-understanding-traffic-signs/](https://daviderrington.net/2018/06/25/reading-and-understanding-traffic-signs/).
